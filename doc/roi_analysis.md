## Cost-Benefit Summary

| Component | Dev Cost | Monthly Savings | Payback Period | Risk |
|-----------|----------|-----------------|----------------|------|
| Predictive Scaling | $40,000 | $20,000 | 2 months | Medium |
| Cost Optimization | $60,000 | $17,500 | 3.5 months | Medium-High |
| Autonomous Ops | $50,000 | $10,000 | 5 months | Low-Medium |
| Multi-Region | $100,000 | -$20,000* | N/A** | High |

\* Multi-region increases costs but provides resilience value
\** ROI measured in uptime and performance, not direct cost savings

## Recommendation

Start with **AI-Powered Predictive Scaling** due to:
1. Highest and fastest ROI (35-40% cost reduction)
2. Moderate risk with clear fallback mechanisms
3. Builds foundation for other ML-based optimizations
4. Leverages existing Prometheus metrics
5. Compatible with current architecture

This provides immediate value while setting up the infrastructure needed for subsequent phases.
